# Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) program has been written by using Python 3 as a function called **dofft**. This function has been validated by comparing with **fft** python library (through SciPy library). 
# Example
For an example, the sinusoidal was generated by using equation `sin(2*pi*f1*time)`, where the `f1` equal to 20 Hz. This signal was applied **dofft** from this code and **fft** from python library. The frequency of **dofft** is 20.068359375 Hz and the frequency of **fft** is 20.5 Hz. The both results is not huge different, where the **dofft** is more close to the `f1` than the **ff** function.
# How to use the function
First, you have to import or call the function file through **from dofft import dofft**. Next, you can type the following command to transform a signal do you have to spectrum
```
freq,spectrum = dofft(signal,nodt,fs)
```
where:
1. `signal` must be list type,
2. `nodt` is number of data transform, and
3. `fs` is the sampling rate or frequency sampling in Hz
# How to compile
```
python3 dft.py
```
